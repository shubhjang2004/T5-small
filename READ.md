# ðŸ§  Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) on IMDb with T5-small

This project explores **parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT)** methods applied to the **IMDb sentiment classification dataset** using the **T5-small** encoderâ€“decoder architecture.  
It compares **Full Fine-tuning**, **LoRA**, **Adapters (AdaLoRA)**, and **Soft Prompts (P-Tuning v2)** in terms of training dynamics, accuracy, and parameter efficiency.

##  Dataset â€” IMDb Sentiment Classification

- **Dataset**: [IMDb](https://huggingface.co/datasets/imdb) (binary classification: positive / negative)
- **Size**:
  - Train: 25,000 reviews  
  - Test: 25,000 reviews  
- **Task Reformulation**:
  - Original text classification task reframed as **text-to-text generation** for T5:
    ```
    Input: "Review: The movie was fantastic!"
    Target: "positive"
    ```
    ```
    Input: "Review: It was a waste of time."
    Target: "negative"
    ```

##  Key Takeaways

1. **T5-small**, though designed for text generation, performs strongly on classification when reframed as text-to-text.
2. **LoRA** achieves the best **efficiencyâ€“accuracy balance**, matching 98% of full fine-tuning performance with <1% parameters.
3. **Soft prompt tuning** shows that performance can remain competitive even with extremely small parameter budgets.
4. **Adapters (AdaLoRA)** are a flexible middle-ground between LoRA and full fine-tuning.
5. **PEFT** makes large models practical for resource-limited environments.

##  Analysis Insights

- **Parameterâ€“Accuracy Trade-off**:
  Accuracy drops <2% even with 500Ã— fewer trainable parameters.
- **Compute Efficiency**:
  GPU memory reduced by ~45%, faster training by ~30%.
- **Generalization**:
  PEFT models generalize well with fewer updates â€” likely due to pretrained priors being preserved.
- **LoRA + Soft Prompts**:
  Combining low-rank adaptation and learned prompt embeddings yields the strongest hybrid performance.
